# BrownBot
Brownbot is a simple bot that I made in python for Discord. This is a simple project for me to play around with Python
as well as getting a chance to work with API's. 

General Features
--------
**!flood**
Clears the screen of all messages. It doesn't delete anything, it just floods the chat with 50 newlines. Just a brute force way of clearing the screen. Useable only by admins.

**!joke**
Tells you a random joke (currently broken. Will be fixed in the near future)

**!chuck**
Tells you a random chuck norris fact

**!info**
Gives you a full list of the working commands.

League of Legends Commands
------------
**!stats**
Gives you stats about a summoner. Currently it displays stats from their unranked, ranked solo, and ranked team games. It's really broken because if a summoner doesn't have stats for one of those gamemodes, then the whole thing breaks and won't display/displays the wrong information.

**!matchhistory**
Gives you stats about the last one or two games the summoner has played. It's 90% finished. The only bug I've come across is similar to !lol, but doesn't break the whole thing. If a summoner has no champion kills in the match, it won't display stats for that match.

**!id**
Simple. Gives the ID of a summoner. It'd be better if people used their ID when using !lol and !matchhistory because it uses one less API call, but it's not a big deal and I don't expect anyone to memorise their ID. Mainly used for development purposes. Works 100%

**!freechamps**
Displays the current rotation of free champions

Steam commands
------------
**!steam** 
Pulls basic info about a steam account such as a user's last played game/play time and online status.

Planned Features / Work in progress
---------
**Pokemon API**
Useful for looking up quick pokemon stats

**Twitter API**
Not exactly sure what I want to do with this yet, but I thought it'd be neat to incorperate twitter somehow.
